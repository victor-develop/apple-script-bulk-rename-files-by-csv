# How to
Put 2 components into a single folder
- Your files to be renamed.
- A csv file, with headers as the first row.
  - the first cell of a row should be old file name
  - the second cell of a row should be a new file name

Now open the rename_by_csv.applescript with script editor, then export to the same folder.

Execute it.
